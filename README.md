## Jacob Yablonski | Personal R Shiny Applications

This repository contains a list of my R Shiny Dashboard Applications.  R Shiny is a web application framework that I've used to create interactive and automated dashboards.  I've used these applications to report on KPIs, to practice my data mining & analysis skills, and to find trends & insights in the project's respective data and display it in an interactive manner.
