## Jacob Yablonski | Personal R Shiny Applications

This repository contains a list of my R Shiny Dashboard Applications.  R Shiny is a web application framework that I've used to create interactive and automated dashboards.  I've used these applications to report on KPIs, to practice my data mining & analysis skills, and to find trends & insights in the project's respective data and display it in an interactive manner.

Each application comes with an About Page that talks about the dashboard and some of its features.  R Shiny is unique compared to Tableau because I'm able to use it to execute web scraping tasks to automate the data retrieval process for some of the dashboards (COVID), as well as communicate with APIs to get up-to-date data (Spotify).
